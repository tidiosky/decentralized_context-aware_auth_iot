#Context Aware Performance Comparison

In this project is proposed a simple comparison of a same smart contract (or chaincode) implemented with Hyperledger and Ethereum. Smart contracts as well as experimental scenarios (Caliper) are available in the src folder. Results/Plots are available in the paper submitted based on these experiments.
